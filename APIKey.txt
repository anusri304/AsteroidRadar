Regarding offline caching for the Image of the Day

Hi Can you please advise on the following

1) If the media type is not image is it fine if I display a placeholder image for The NASA image of the day?

2) Can I display the same placeholder image when the user is offline as I am not saving the image in the database?

Good questions! To answer both, using a placeholder image is a good idea either if the API doesn't return an image (sometimes it returns a video URL instead), or if we're offline. Both Picasso and Glide allow using a placeholder image to display in case no image is available.

Also, these libraries support caching the image, so if we don't have a connection and the image was previously cached, it would be loaded locally (see here and here).
